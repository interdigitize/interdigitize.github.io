  <h1>For Kärstin, four hours of practice before 10 AM is the start of a perfect day. </h1>

      Karstin has been playing classical piano all her life, and feels free when she performs. Thirty seconds before she walks on stage, nerves fire and she starts getting anxious, but the moment she sits at a Steinway, she enters another dimension. The concert hall and audience fades away as she reminisces with her longtime friend, and the Debussy preludes echo through the hall.

      Karstin is also a fashion design enthusiast. When she was 14, she met Nancy, an expert in textiles, sewing techniques, and fashion design. Nancy gave Karstin the skills needed to design clothes, by teaching her about many different personalities of fabric, how to draft and modify patterns, and transform a fashion sketch into a finished garment.

    <h4>
      Kärstin is interested in expanding the audience of classical music by presenting it in new ways and merging it with other art forms and genres. Her dream project is to design a fashion line inspired by classical music.

      While a full time college student, practicing piano 25+ hours a week, and working part-time as a marketing assistant at a shopping center, Kärstin found time to organize a fashion show featuring small collections by 12 student designers. The show, Cutting Fashion, was a huge success with over a thousand people in attendance.

      Planning the event and creating her own collection was fulfilling, but her favorite part of the experience was watching the reactions of the designers’ as their lines walked the runway. The fashion show gave Kärstin a taste of the rush and excitement that comes from working on a project with others.

      After a fashion internship with Karen Kane, Kärstin decided to focus her career on music education and opened Glee Music Academy where she currently teaches piano lessons and show choir classes.
